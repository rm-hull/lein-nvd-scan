[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) dependency checker
library.

When run in your project, all the JARs on the classpath
will be checked for known security vulnerabilities. `nvd-clojure` extracts project
dependencies and passes them to a library called [Dependency-Check](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck) which does the vulnerability analysis. Quoting the README for that library:

> Dependency-Check is a utility that attempts to detect publicly disclosed
> vulnerabilities contained within project dependencies. It does this by
> determining if there is a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier for
> a given dependency. If found, it will generate a report linking to the
> associated CVE entries.

### Installation and basic usage

> _Please see also:_ [Avoiding classpath interference](#avoiding-classpath-interference)

#### Leiningen

<details>

Please create a separate project consisting of `[nvd-clojure/nvd-clojure "2.11.0"]`. Said project can be located inside the targeted repo's Git repository.

```
(defproject nvd-helper "local"
  :description "nvd-clojure helper project"
  :dependencies [[nvd-clojure "2.11.0"]
                 [org.clojure/clojure "1.11.1"]]
  :jvm-opts ["-Dclojure.main.report=stderr"])
```

Please do not add nvd-clojure as a dependency or plugin in the project.clj of the project to be analysed.

Then you can run, within this helper project:

```
lein with-profile -user run -m nvd.task.check "" "$(cd <YOUR_PROJECT>; lein with-profile -user,-dev classpath)"
```

An empty string is passed as the first argument, for backwards compatibility reasons. You can also pass a filename instead, denoting a .json file with extra options ([example](https://github.com/rm-hull/nvd-clojure/blob/master/.github/nvd-config.json)).

The `classpath` command should reflect a production-like classpath as closely as possible: it should not include dev/test tooling, plugins, etc.

If you are using a multi-modules solution (e.g. `lein-monolith`), you should ensure that each module is included in this classpath; else they will not be analysed.

</details>

#### Clojure CLI

<details>

Please create a separate project consisting exclusively of `nvd-clojure/nvd-clojure {:mvn/version "2.11.0"}`. Said project can be located inside the targeted repo's Git repository.

Please do not add nvd-clojure as a dependency in the deps.edn of the project to be analysed.

> You can accomplish something similar with user-level aliases, or with the `:replace-deps` option, at your own risk.

Then you can run, within this helper project:

```
clojure -J-Dclojure.main.report=stderr -M -m nvd.task.check "" "$(cd <YOUR_PROJECT>; clojure -Spath -A:any:aliases)"
```

An empty string is passed as the first argument, for backwards compatibility reasons. You can also pass a filename instead, denoting a .json file with extra options ([example](https://github.com/rm-hull/nvd-clojure/blob/master/.github/nvd-config.json)).

The `-Spath` command should reflect a production-like classpath as closely as possible: it should not include dev/test tooling, etc.

If you are using a multi-modules solution (e.g. [Polylith](https://github.com/polyfy/polylith)), you should ensure that each module is included in this classpath; else they will not be analysed.

</details>

#### Clojure CLI Tool

<details>

If you have CLI version 1.10.3.933 or later, you can also install `nvd-clojure` as a "tool":

```bash
clojure -Ttools install nvd-clojure/nvd-clojure '{:mvn/version "RELEASE"}' :as nvd
```

Then you can run:

```bash
clojure -J-Dclojure.main.report=stderr -Tnvd nvd.task/check :classpath \""$(clojure -Spath -A:any:aliases)\""
```

You can optionally pass a `:config-filename`, denoting a .json file with extra options ([example](https://github.com/rm-hull/nvd-clojure/blob/master/.github/nvd-config.json), [doc](#configuration)).

```bash
clojure -J-Dclojure.main.report=stderr -Tnvd nvd.task/check :classpath \""$(clojure -Spath -A:any:aliases)\"" :config-filename \""nvd-config.json\""
```

The `-Spath` command should reflect a production-like classpath as closely as possible: it should not include dev/test tooling, etc.

If you are using a multi-modules solution (e.g. [Polylith](https://github.com/polyfy/polylith)), you should ensure that each module is included in this classpath; else they will not be analysed.

## Usage overview

Run the program as indicated in the previous section. The first time it runs, it will download (and
cache) various databases from https://nvd.nist.gov. Subsequent runs will
periodically check and update the local database, but the initial run could
therefore be quite slow - of the order of ten minutes or more, so give it time.

On completion, a summary table is output to the console, and a suite of reports
will be produced in the project's `./target/nvd/` directory. If vulnerabilities
are detected, then the check process will exit abnormally, thereby
causing any CI build environment to error. (This behaviour can be overriden by
setting a `:fail-threshold` in the project [configuration](#configuration-options)).

### Example

There is an [example project](https://github.com/rm-hull/nvd-clojure/blob/master/example/project.clj)
which has dependencies with known vulnerabilities
([CVE-2016-3720](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-3720),
[CVE-2015-5262](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5262),
[CVE-2014-3577](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3577)).
This can be demonstrated by running the following:

```bash
clojure -J-Dclojure.main.report=stderr -Tnvd nvd.task/check :classpath \""$(cd example; lein with-profile -user classpath)\""
```

This will download the NVD database, and then cross-check the classpath
dependencies against known vulnerabilities. The following summary report will
be displayed on the console:

![summary-report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rm-hull/nvd-clojure/master/example/img/summary-report.png)

Note that as there were some vulnerabilities detected, the process was aborted,
with error code -1 hence the reported _subprocess failed_ message.

More detailed reports (both HTML & XML) are written into the
_./example/target/nvd/_ directory as follows:

![detail-report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rm-hull/nvd-clojure/master/example/img/detail-report.png)

## Upgrading dependencies

You may use the built-in dependency tree reporters to find out what the
dependency relationships are:

    $ lein deps :tree # for Leiningen
    $ clojure -Stree # for deps.edn

...make sure to use aliases/profiles in such a way that reflects the production classpath.

[antq](https://github.com/liquidz/antq) will traverse your project
dependencies, and suggest upgraded versions, and can optionally be configured
to update the project file.

## Configuration

The default settings for `nvd-clojure` are usually sufficient for most projects, but
can be customized with a .json config file ([example](https://github.com/rm-hull/nvd-clojure/blob/master/.github/nvd-config.json)).
The filename denoting that file is the first argument to be passed to nvd-clojure when invoking it as a `main` (`-m`) program.

When invoking it via Clojure Tools, it must be passed as a `:config-filename` option, e.g.

```bash
clojure -Tnvd nvd.task/check :classpath \""$(clojure -Spath)\"" :config-filename \""nvd-config.json\""
```

Note the escaped double quotes around the filename, to ensure that Clojure reads the command line argument as a string, not a symbol.

## Configuration options

The keys must reside inside a `"nvd": {...}` entry, not at the top-level. A top-level `"delete-config?": false` entry is expected for the time being ([example](https://github.com/rm-hull/nvd-clojure/blob/59dd3f33cf87b1527fdc06f78eb97d9fad990ff0/.github/nvd-config.json)), for backwards compatibility reasons.

There are many dependency-check settings (for example to connect via a proxy, or
to specify an alternative to the H2 database). The exact settings can be seen
in the [config.clj](https://github.com/rm-hull/nvd-clojure/blob/master/src/nvd/config.clj) source file and cross-referenced to the dependency-check
wiki.

There are some specific settings below which are worthy of a few comments:

* `"fail-threshold"` default value `0`; checks the highest CVSS score across all dependencies, and fails if this threshold is breached.
  - As CVSS score ranges from `0..10`, the default value will cause a build to fail even for the lowest rated
  vulnerability.
  - Set to `11` if you never want the build to fail.
* `"data-directory"` default value is the data dir of `DependencyCheck`, e.g. `~/.m2/repository/org/owasp/dependency-check-utils/3.2.1/data/`
  - It shouldn't normally be necessary to change this
* `"suppression-file"` default unset
  - Allows for CVEs to be permanently suppressed.
  - See [DependencyCheck documentation](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/) for the XML file-format.
  - [See also](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/general/suppression.html)
* `"verbose-summary"` default false
  - When set to true, the summary table includes a severity determination for all dependencies.
  - When set to false, the summary table includes only packages that have either low or high severity determination.
* `"output-dir"` default value `target/nvd/`: the directory to save reports into
* `"throw-if-check-unsuccessful"` - makes the program exit by throwing an exception instead of by invoking `System/exit`.
  - This can ease certain usages.

## Logging

You can override the default logging behaviour by providing a `simplelogger.properties` file on the nvd-clojure classpath. 
Note that this is not the classpath of your project. See `resources/simplelogger.properties` for the default
config.

You can also set logging properties directly through Java system properties (the `-D` flags), for example:

```
clojure -J-Dclojure.main.report=stderr -J-Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.org.apache.commons=error -Tnvd nvd.task/check # ...
```

## Avoiding classpath interference

nvd-clojure has some Java dependencies, which in turn can have CVEs themselves.

Likewise, a given project's dependencies can overlap and therefore affect nvd-clojure's, leading it to incorrect functioning.

For these reasons, it is strongly advised to follow the installation/usage instructions carefully.

## Attribution

`nvd-clojure` uses **Jeremy Long**'s [Dependency-Check](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck)
library to do the heavy lifting.
