(defn nvd "
  Scans project dependencies, attempting to detect publicly disclosed
  vulnerabilities contained within dependent JAR files. It does this by
  determining if there is a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier
  for a given dependency. On completion, a summary table is displayed on
  the console (showing the status for each dependency), and detailed report
  linking to the associated CVE entries.

  This task should be invoked with one of three commands:

      check  - will optionally download the latest database update files,
               and then run the analyze and report stages. Typically, if
               the database has been updated recently, then the update
               stage will be skipped.

      purge  - will remove the local database files. Subsequently running
               the 'check' command will force downloading the files again,
               which could take a long time.

      update - will attempt to download the latest database updates, and
               incorporate them into the local store. Usually not necessary,
               as this is incorporated into the 'check' command.

  Any text after the command are treated as arguments and are passed directly
  directly to the command for further processing.
